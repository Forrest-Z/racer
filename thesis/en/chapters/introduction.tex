Autonomous vehicles are slowly but steadily making their way from research facilities to the public roads around the world and it seems inevitable that they will soon become part of our daily lives. Autonomous vehicles could have a significant impact on transportation of people and goods. For example, thousands of people die in car accidents every year because of human error \cite{Road_accidents}. Some believe that replacing humans with accurate electronic sensors and computer algorithms, which never make errors, could reduce the number of accidents on roads significantly. It seems that companies around the world see the potential in this technology and invest a lot of effort and money in research of self-driving cars. Even though nobody can guarantee that autonomous vehicles will never make errors and that they will solve other problems of road transportation we face today, the trend is clear. The key to the success of this technology will be reliable and robust algorithms which will work in all driving scenarios and weather conditions and which the public will trust.

The idea of self-driving cars is far from new. Prototypes of autonomous vehicles were demonstrated on public roads as early as the 1980s. Among some of the well-known projects from this era were for example the NavLab vehicle of the Carnegie Mellon University \cite{NavLab} or the project of Ernst Dickmanns in cooperation with the Daimler company \cite{Ernst_Dickmanns}. The DARPA challenges, organized between 2004 and 2007, gained a lot of media attention. We can see that self-driving cars are no longer just science fiction. Since then, many driving assistants such as adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assistants, parallel parking assistants, collision warning, and emergency braking assistants started appearing in commercially available vehicles. Some systems, like the Tesla Autopilot, go even further and allow complex autonomous maneuvers such as overtaking other vehicles.

These commercially available assistants provide the user only with partial autonomy. The driver is required to pay attention to the road all the time and he or she is required to be prepared to take control of the vehicle if the system fails or if it cannot handle the traffic situation. Fully autonomous vehicles will not require any human interaction. They might even lack any means of manual driving. The computer will be responsible for the vehicle from the start to the destination irrespective of the weather or traffic. There is an ongoing research into full autonomy by some companies like Waymo and Uber and prototypes of vehicles equipped with this technology are already being tested on public roads.

One of the key problems in autonomous driving is the ability to find a good trajectory for the car in various different scenarios. This trajectory must be safe for the passengers of the vehicle and for other road users. It must also conform to road limitations such as speed limits and other traffic rules. Automated planning is an area of artificial intelligence which gives us means to formulate and solve this problem. For a well-defined planning problem which describes the physics of the vehicle and our goals, we can find a sequence of control inputs which will drive the vehicle to the goal as we need.

In this thesis, our focus is trajectory planning for fast moving cars. We will design and develop an autonomous vehicle for the task of autonomous racing. The racing scenario is simplification of real-world driving. It requires us to avoid collisions and to find efficient trajectories while moving at high speeds and to adapt to unforeseen obstacles on the road. At the same time, this simplified problem allows us to ignore any traffic rules. We do not have to consider any speed limits, crossroads, stop signs, or other road users.

We will create an autonomous racing agent which utilizes a trajectory planning algorithm to find fast routes along the racing circuit. We will test different algorithms for searching solutions to the planning problem and compare them in a series of experiments on a real-world car model with sensors and an embedded on-board computer.

First, we introduce the autonomous driving problem and split it into several sub-problems. We give a brief overview of related works in the field of autonomous driving. We describe an architecture of an artificial agent for the task of autonomous racing.

Next, we examine the individual sub-problems we must solve in order to create the racing agent. We analyze and formulate the trajectory planning problem for a fast moving car. We describe adaptations of several planning algorithms for our specific problem. We study how the vehicle reacts to steering commands and we describe a model of the actuators and of the vehicle movement. We then describe algorithms for following the planned trajectory.

Finally, we implement the racing agent and we conduct several experiments to verify the performance and success rate of our algorithms and we test them on a custom-built real-world experimental vehicle.
