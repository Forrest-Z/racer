@techreport{Nilsson_astar,
abstract = {This report describes the results of research during the first eight
months on the project “Application of Intelligent Automata to Reconnaissance.”
The primary goal of this project is to investigate techniques in artificial
intelligence applied to the control of a mobile automaton in a realistic environment.
The main emphasis is in the design of a hierarchy of computer programs that
will accept visual and other sensory information from the automaton and direct
its actions toward the completion of missions requiring the abilities to plan
ahead and to learn from previous experience. The automaton itself is a four-wheeled,
self-powered vehicle with two simple arms for grasping objects. It will carry
a television camera an optical range-measuring device, tactile sensors, a transceiver,
and storage and routing logic. The vehicle will be radio-controlled by an SDS
940 time-shared computer. The computer, with the aid of special image-processing
hardware, will analyze television pictures transmitted from the vehicle and
will calculate a sequence of vehicle actions designed to accomplish the task(s)
given to the automaton. Calculation of the appropriate action sequence will
be performed by problem-solving computer programs which will use internally-stored
“models of the world” generated and abstracted during the course
of automaton explorations. The environment of the automaton, initially, will
be a 20X30 foot room populated with simple objects. Sample tasks will include
transporting these objects and arranging them in specified ways, under stated
constraints. Later it is planned that the automaton attempt more complex tasks
in the larger, richer environment of corridors and offices outside of its computer
room. At the present time most of the special hardware has been designed and
is scheduled for completion by 1 April 1967. With the SDS 940 computer now
delivered , programming the actual vehicle will begin in four months. In the
meantime, simulation experiments concerned with representations or models of
the environment, control strategies, and pattern recognition are being conducted.
Looking beyond the duration of the present project, toward the goal of building
increasingly sophisticated automata, it will be important to initiate several
independent but contributory research efforts as soon as possible. The most
important of these concerns the problems of threedimensional visual perception
and pattern recognition. Appendicies include:

	abstract = "Autonomous driving requires accurate information about the vehicle pose and motion state in order to achieve precise tracking of the planned trajectory. In this paper we propose a robust architecture to localize a high performance race car and show experimental results with speeds up to 150 km h-1 and utilizing approximately 80% of the available friction level. The concept has been applied using the development vehicle DevBot taking part in the Roborace competition. To achieve robust and reliable performance, we use two independent localization pipelines, one based on GPS and one on LIDARs. We propose to fuse them via a Kalman Filter based on a purely kinematic model and show, that it can outperform a high fidelity model under realistic race conditions. An outstanding property of this concept is that it does not depend on any of the vehicles parameter and is therefore robust to varying tire and track conditions. Further we present an adaption method for the measurement covariances based on the track layout. This allows to combine the strengths of each localization method."
